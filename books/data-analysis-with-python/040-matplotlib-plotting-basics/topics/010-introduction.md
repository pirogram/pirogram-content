title: Plotting basics with Matplotlib
---
  Plots can be created using `Object-oriented interface` or `state-less` (pyplot) interface or a combination of the two.
  In case of `Object-oriented interface`, a figure is created using pyplot and then `object methods` are used to create plots on the figure and customize them.
  In matplotlib.pyplot various states are preserved across function calls, so that it keeps track of things like the `current figure` and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the `current axes`.
