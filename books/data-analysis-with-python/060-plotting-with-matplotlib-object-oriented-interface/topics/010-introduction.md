title: Plotting with Matplotlib Object Oriented Interface
---
  We saw how to create plots with `state-less (pyplot)` interface.
  In this section, we will discuss how to make use of the native `Object-oriented interface` in matplotlib. It is slightly more complicated but more powerful as it allows for greater control over the axes in figure. This proves to be quite useful when we are dealing with a figure with multiple axes.

  In this method, We first create a figure USING pyplot and then `object methods` are used to create plots on the axes and customize them.
