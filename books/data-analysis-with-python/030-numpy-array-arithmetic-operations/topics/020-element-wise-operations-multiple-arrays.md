title: Element wise operations between multiple arrays
---
  Arithmetic operations between multiple Numpy arrays are applied element wise. A new array gets created which can be saved to a variable. The operator precedence follow the same rules as that in Python (PEMDAS - parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)

code: |
  import numpy as np
  a = np.arange(10)
  b = np.arange(0,100, 10)
  array_sum = a + b
  print(array_sum)
  %timeit a + b
---
  We need a loop to perform the same operation in Python and it is much slower.

  list_sum = [sum(num) for num in zip(a, b)]
  print (list_sum)
  %timeit [sum(num) for num in zip(a, b)]
---
  Operations like +=, -=, *= act in place and modify the existing array.

  Find the product of the two dimensional arrays given below and save to `array_product`.
code: |
  import numpy as np
  a = np.arange(6).reshape(3,2)
  b = np.arange(0, 60 ,10).reshape(3,2)

---
  Operations like comparison between multiple Numpy arrays are applied element wise. They return an array of booleans.
