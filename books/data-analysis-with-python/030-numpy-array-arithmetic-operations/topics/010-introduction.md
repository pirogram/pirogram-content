title: Numpy Array arithmetic operations
---
  Numpy arrays support mathematical operations between an array and a scalar and between multiple arrays of identical shape. These operations on apply element-wise and are more efficient than loops.  Many unary operations are also implemented as methods of the ndarray class and support various statistical operations. Arithmetic operations on arrays with different shapes are handled using Broadcasting.
