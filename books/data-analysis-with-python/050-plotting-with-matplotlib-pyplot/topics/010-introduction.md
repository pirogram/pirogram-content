title: Simple Plotting with Matplotlib pyplot
--- |
  [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) offers a collection of command style functions to create simple plots. In the earlier section [matplotlib conceptual model](), we saw that the first call to plt.plot automatically creates the necessary figure and axes to achieve the desired plot. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: eg, create a figure, create a plotting area in a figure, plot some lines in a plotting area, decorate the plot with labels.
  Let us see how to create a plot and control its properties using pyplot.
