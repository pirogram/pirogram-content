  Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library in Python. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
  This module deals with the creating and/or loading data into the data structures, getting an overview of the dataframe and performing operations on the entire dataframe or a slice of it.
  The material on Pandas covered here builds on top of Numpy and if you are unfamiliar with Numpy, we strongly recommend that you go through [Numpy topics](https://www.pirogram.com/@numpy-array-basics/introduction) first.
