title: Introduction

  Pandas is a Python library highly used for data analysis. Python has been great for data preparation but lacked the features such as a tabular data structure which is key to data handling. Data cleaning/preparation, exploratory analysis, modelling and visualization are integral part of the Data Analysis process. Real world data is seldom clean and the data often needs to be pre-processed before model building. Pandas library offers 1-D data structure (Series) as well as 2-D data structure (DataFrame) using which the entire data analysis workflow can be carried out in Python.

  This module deals with the creating and/or loading data into the data structures and getting an overview of the object.
  
  The material on Pandas covered here builds on top of Numpy and if you are unfamiliar with Numpy, we strongly recommend that you go through [Numpy topics](https://www.pirogram.com/@numpy-array-basics/introduction) first.
