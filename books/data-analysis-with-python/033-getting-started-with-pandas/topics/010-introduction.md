  Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library in Python. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

  The material on Pandas covered here builds on top of Numpy and if you are unfamiliar with Numpy, we strongly recommend that you go through [Numpy topics](https://www.pirogram.com/@numpy-array-basics/introduction) first.
