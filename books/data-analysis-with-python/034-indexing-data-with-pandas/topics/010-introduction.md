  In programming, Indexing refers to a way of accessing an element or a group of elements from data based on position. In case of Pandas, the concept extends beyond simple position based indexing using `[]`. Pandas data structures are labelled at index and column level and they can be index based on those labels or position. The label based indexing is done using `DataFrame.loc` whereas position based indexing is done using `DataFrame.iloc`. Pandas also supports a third type of indexing based on condition.
  In this section, we will cover the methods mentioned above in detail.
