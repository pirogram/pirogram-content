  Sorting a list of items is a very common operation in software development. There are a lot of problems that are directly related to sorting (e.g. sort the emails by arrival date) and then there are some other problems that can be simplified by sorting the items (e.g. finding `kth` largest element in a list).

  First, we'll explore the sorting functionality provided by Python w.r.t. sorting. We'll then apply it various situations that are can encounter in real world software applications.
