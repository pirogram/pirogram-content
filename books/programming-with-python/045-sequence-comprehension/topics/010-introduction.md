  It's very common to take a list or dict, iterate through all the items and transform it into another list or dict. For example, we could have a list of the form `['1', '2', '3']` and we change the data type to `int` and transform the list to `[1, 2, 3]`. While it's possible to do it using the iteration method, the comprehension syntax gives us a more compact way of achieving the same.

  This chapter is optional in a way. Whatever you can achieve using comprehension, you can achieve using `for item in list_or_dict:` approach. However, if you are reading Python code written by someone else, you are likely to encounter some bits of code that use this syntax. So, familiarity with this syntax would always be helpful.
